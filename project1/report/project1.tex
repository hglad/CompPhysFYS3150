 % State problem. Briefly describe method and data. Summarize main results.
A common issue with performing heavy numerical calculations is the limited amount of resources available in a computing device. For this reason it is important to write optimized code that does not use more resources than a computer has available. To demonstrate this, we use various numerical methods to solve the one-dimensional Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our methods were written in C++ and applied on a linear set of equations representing the Poisson equation. We observe that our own written algorithm performs faster and is less prone to memory errors compared to using a regular LU-decomposition performed by the Armadillo library.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Programs using poorly optimized code will often take longer to run, and in the worst case the program will not execute properly. If the method used for solving a problem requires storing too many values in the RAM (random access memory), the computer will run out of available memory and the program will never finish running.

%Discuss background, physical importance and possibly some history of
%the problem that is being studied in this paper.


\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
% describe chronologically solutions of a)-e)

Describe method. Define data model and likelihood. Outline how the
likelihood was computed (grid or MCMC).

Define the power law model in terms of $Q$ and $n$. 

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

Summarize properties of data. Which data are used (experiment,
frequencies etc.)? Pixel resolution ($N_{\textrm{side}}$),
$\ell_{\textrm{max}}$ -- everything necessary to repeat the analysis
for other researchers.

Show a sky map of the smoothed data. Use the Healpix routine
``smoothing'' to do this; it works just like anafast. Smooth with a
$7^{\circ}$ beam, and plot with ``map2gif''. Show the RMS pattern as
well. 

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}


Show the 2D likelihood contours. Summarize constraints on $Q$ and
$n$. 


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Summarize results. Discuss their importance, referring to the
discovery to the initial seeds for structure formation. Mention that
these results are in good agreement with expectations from
inflationary theory.
